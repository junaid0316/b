      <p class="firstpara"><span class="we">We Assign –</span> We require topic ideas from our clients for every blog post they order. If the client requests our professional opinion on the topics, we will share few ideas with them for their review and approval. We will share topics based on our research on the business and the industry of the client. The client can then pick the best ones for the blog posts. After learning about the client’s business and conducting our research, the writer will begin writing blog posts.
      </p><br>
      <p class="firstpara"><span class="we">You Approve –</span> Once the content is ready from our writers, we will forward it to you for review and for approving it for publishing on your blog. You can suggest any changes that you might think are vital to be added to the blog posts or point out any error that we might have missed during proofreading.
      </p><br>
      <p class="firstpara"><span class="we">We Deliver –</span> After finalizing the content and receiving your approval, we will start publishing and scheduling blog posts on your website. The frequency of publishing the content on your blog may vary, based on the blogging package you have ordered. And if you would like to request minor changes in the blog post once it has been published on the blog, we will gladly do it for you.</p>
